# what is this?
I tried to create 3d town with using [OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page)

![another image](4E73427C-9B97-4AF6-87D6-A1392351DA3B.jpeg)


# How:
1. Download map data (.osm file) from [this web site](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
2. Put the .osm file in Assets/OSM/Data/ Folder (important)
3. In SampleScene, Find the component <MapController> atacched to gameobject "OSMmap", change its OSMfileName value. If you named your .osm file as "name.osm", you shoude enter "name.osm". 



# Now:
1. Show Roads
2. Show Buildings
3. Show Parks

- Both of them are assigned one material
- Their location is real-based, but their color and look are not real-based.#
